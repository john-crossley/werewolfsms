<h2>About Werewolf</h2>
<p>
    Werewolf is a game of mystery, suspicion, logic, lies and social engineering. Played in person and on internet forums, 
    it is a battle between the uninformed majority and the informed minority.
</p>

<h2>How does online Werewolf work?</h2>
<p>If you've played Werewolf (or Mafia) in person before, you might be thinking that an online version couldn't possibly work. That there are no
    subtle tells in body language or the slip ups people make in speech will happen. Whilst it's true that online is a different kind of game, it can still work.
    Consider that for many decades poker was played face to face, many argued that online poker would never take off. There are poker players today who have made millions online.
</p>
<p>The game is undeniably different. But what is lacking in body language and face to face communication can be made up in other ways.<br />
    First, players can have a more accurate record of a game's history. (Some have said, that if you give the Village a pen and paper, the Werewolves will never win)<br/>
    Secondly, the moderator isn't a person, it's handled automatically. Because of this, more roles are possible (for both good and evil), meaning more information is available
    to the players to logically reason about the intentions of and allegiance of other players.

<h2>The Village</h2>

<p>The village represent the uninformed majority. None of them know anyone's role apart from their own. Most players will take on the role of 
a villager, unsure of whom they can trust as they work out who the werewolves are.</p>

<h2>The Seer</h2>

<p>The Seer is a special role who is part of the village. Once per night, they can pick a player to learn whether they
are an innocent villager, or an evil werewolf. The seer must be careful however, should they reveal their role the werewolves will surely kill them the next night.</p>

<h2>The Protector</h2>

<p>A guardian angel of sorts, once per night the Protector can shield a player from harm. Although the Protector cannot choose the same person to guard two consecutive nights.</p>

<h2>The Huntsman</h2>
<?php require 'header.php'; ?>

<p>A fearless individual determined to protect the innocent, even at the expense of himself. At night, the Huntsman can guard a player of their choosing from the werewolves. If that person is attacked, the Huntsman and a randomly select werewolf will both be killed.</p>

<h2>The Gravedigger</h2>

<p>The Gravedigger is able to check dead players at night. He can learn the exact role that player had.</p>

<h2>Lycans</h2>

<p>Lycans are unfortunate villagers afflicted with a mild form of Lycanthropy. They're not evil, and are on the side of the village. Unforunately however, the Seer will view any such individuals as werewolves at night. The Lycans therefore, despite being part of the village, are a burden on it.</p>

<h2>The Werewolves</h2>

<p>The werewolves represent the informed minority. It is their goal to remain undetected long enough to kill every villager. 
    Each werewolf is aware who the wolves are and can communicate in secret.</p>
    
<h2>The Bloodhound</h2>

<p>Bloodhounds spend their night sniffing out the werewolves prey. Once per night, they can learn the role of a member of a village, directing the wolves to more important targets like the Seer.</p>
    
<h2>The Shapeshifter</h2>

<p>The Shapeshifter is a powerful werewolf, able to turn the tide of an otherwise hopelessly lost game. The Shapeshifter has a one time ability to swap identities with a victim of the werewolves. The rest of the game will see that the Shapeshifter has died, but 
in truth, he has now assumed the identity of the dead villager.</p>
